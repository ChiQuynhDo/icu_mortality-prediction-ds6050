# Predicting Mortality Risk of ICU Patients Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery

### Abstract 

Patients within the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) have a high risk of mortality and health deterioration. It is important to constantly observe and gather data on these patients to track and assess their health status. However, more research needs to be done on deep learning models that can be used to predict mortality of ICU patients, and more specifically, ICU patients who have just undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery. These patients are especially prone to sickness and mortality, and little research has been completed on predictive models using this type of data. This project involves the preliminary development of several time series models (RNN, LSTM, and GRU) that can be utilized to predict mortality risk of ICU patients post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The data was queried from the MIMIC-IV database, which contains de-identified medical data available for research purposes. The models reveal promising results that could positively impact patients within intensive care units, however further work and research are necessary.

## 🔧 Ongoing Enhancements by Chi Do (Summer 2025)

After completing this team project as part of **DS6050: Deep Learning** at the University of Virginia, I was inspired by the mission behind it — exploring how data science and machine learning can contribute to human health and well-being.

Driven by this purpose, I’ve continued to develop this project independently. My goal is to enhance its clinical relevance, interpretability, and usability for real-world deployment. These enhancements are being tracked in the `/chi_dev_extension/` folder.

### 🚀 Current Focus Areas:
- 📊 **Model Explainability** using SHAP to visualize feature impact on predictions
- ⚙️ **Hyperparameter Optimization** with Optuna for better performance
- 🧱 **Modularization** of LSTM training/inference code for reuse
- 🌐 **Streamlit Web Demo** for interactive ICU risk prediction
- 📄 **Expanded Documentation** for accessibility by technical and non-technical users

These updates reflect my mission-driven approach to data science — turning research into tools that can benefit patients, healthcare providers, and society.
