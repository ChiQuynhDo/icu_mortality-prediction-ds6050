# Predicting-Mortality-Risk-of-ICU-Patients-Post-Coronary-Artery-Bypass-Graft-Surgery

### Abstract 

Patients within the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) have a high risk of mortality and health deterioration. It is important to constantly observe and gather data on these patients to track and assess their health status. However, more research needs to be done on deep learning models that can be used to predict mortality of ICU patients, and more specifically, ICU patients who have just undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery. These patients are especially prone to sickness and mortality, and little research has been completed on predictive models using this type of data. This project involves the preliminary development of several time series models (RNN, LSTM, and GRU) that can be utilized to predict mortality risk of ICU patients post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The data was queried from the MIMIC-IV database, which contains de-identified medical data available for research purposes. The models reveal promising results that could positively impact patients within intensive care units, however further work and research are necessary.
